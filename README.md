# dev

tmux workspace launcher for Claude Code agents: project picker, git worktrees, agent-state sidebar, session restore. Single Go binary on top of tmux.

Status: not built yet. It replaces the bash `dev` scripts in [ppf/terminal](https://github.com/ppf/terminal) (`tmux/sessions/`), phase by phase with strict parity. See [docs/plan.md](docs/plan.md).

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/ppf/dev@latest
```

## Development

```bash
go test ./...                                              # unit tests, never start tmux
go test -tags integration -count=1 ./internal/integration/ # isolated tmux servers; local only, needs tmux 3.8 + exported ~/.tmux
```
